### Lecture 1
#### The first verse
Sriharim .....
Oue happiness and unhappiness depens on **karma**. The karma that we have done in this life and past lives.
If you have lot of good karma. You come to vedanta.
 



### Quotes 
**We are not bodies having spiritual experince. We are spiritual beings experiencing the body**<br>
**Lord is present everywhere/in all the materials of the universe as cause (karanam)**
**Every religion struggles to prove that god exists. On the other hand, do you need any proof for your existence?


### Words
#### Pratyaksha:
Experience gained with senses. Seeing. Smelling. hearing
#### Paroksha:
Knowledge that we get from the range of sense organs.Inference; Draw hypothesis; Everything done in Sciece is Paroksha anubhuti. All of scientific knowledge is inference (observation). All of religion (is based not based on observation) is also paroksha based on belief (we read a book and believe that it is right). 
#### Aparoksha: 
Vedanta is neither Pratyaksha nor Paroksha. It deals with our real nature. It is not pratyaksha, because we can't see it like seeing other objects. It is not Paroksha because you don't need to believe. Do you need to belive that you exist? This is **self illumined existence is called aparoksha** 

Meaning of aparoksha (as per Swamit Vidyaranya) 
Akshanam indriyanam adhishtanam 
It is not which is beyone our sensory system. But that is **very ground of** functioning of the senses.
